# Menu-Driven C Program

This repository contains a collection of menu-driven C programs that allow users to perform various operations. Each program displays a menu with different options, and the user can select an option to perform a specific operation.

## Features

- Each program offers a menu with multiple options.
- Users can select an option to perform a specific operation, such as arithmetic calculations, file operations, data manipulations, etc.
- Programs validate user input and handle errors gracefully.
- Programs provide clear instructions and output to guide the user.

## Requirements

- C compiler: The programs are written in C, so you need a C compiler to compile and run the programs. You can use popular C compilers like GCC or Clang.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files for the desired program.

2. Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, run the following command:

Replace `program_name` with the actual name of the program file.

3. Run the compiled program:

Replace `program_name` with the actual name of the program file.

4. The program will display a menu with options. Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation and follow the prompts to enter the required input.

5. Once the operation is performed, the program will display the result or appropriate output. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to perform additional operations or choose the exit option to end the program.

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the usage of the programs:

1. Arithmetic Operations: `(codes/calc.c)`

2. File Operations: `(codes/fileop.c)`

3. Data Manipulations: `(codes/manipulation.c)`

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new features or programs, feel free to submit a pull request.
